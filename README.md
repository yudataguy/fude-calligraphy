# 筆 / FUDE

A local, build-free web app that renders Japanese characters as **sumi-e brush
strokes**, drawn in correct stroke order, with ink synthesized in a WebGL2 fragment
shader along each character's medians. A calligraphy-feel kanji/kana learning tool —
not an animation-export pipeline.

> Strokes are **distance fields in the fragment shader**, not tessellated ribbons.
> Medians are *data* (from the animCJK corpus); ink is *expressive* (synthesized).
> Those two layers stay separate at every level of the code.

## Run it

Vanilla ES modules, **no build step**. Data files are `fetch`ed, so `file://` will
not work — serve over HTTP from the project root:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000
```

Any static server works (`npx serve`, nginx, etc.). WebGL2 is required (no WebGL1
fallback).

### Shareable state

The initial view can be set from the URL:

```
?q=日本語     text to render (kanji / kana / sentence)
?n=1          stroke-order numbers on
?dir=tate     縦書き vertical writing
?anim=all     animate all strokes at once (default: sequential)
```

e.g. `http://localhost:8000/?q=水&n=1`

## Freehand brush demo

`brush-demo.html` is a **standalone, dependency-free** page for *writing* Japanese
by hand — drag on the washi with a mouse, finger, or stylus and it renders live
sumi ink. Stroke width follows your speed (and stylus pressure when available):
press slow for a fat wet line, flick fast for a thin 掠れ dry tail. It has ink-load,
dry-brush and bleed controls, a 田 guide grid, ghost **手本** model characters to
trace (永 水 山 …), undo/clear, and PNG export with a red seal.

It also has a **運筆再生 auto-writer**: type up to four characters and the brush
writes them itself in correct stroke order — medians from the bundled animCJK
data, per-stroke endings (止め/はね/払い/点) from KanjiVG, laid out 縦書き. The
synthetic strokes run through the same brush engine as hand strokes, so the
animation gets the full ink physics. Freehand drawing works from `file://`, but
the auto-writer fetches `assets/data/*.json`, so serve over http for that:

```
python3 -m http.server 8000    # then open localhost:8000/brush-demo.html
```

## What works (V1)

- **F1** 用筆 controls — 提按 pressure, 中鋒↔側鋒 tip, 蔵鋒↔露鋒 entry, 墨量 ink-load,
  にじみ bleed, 掠れ kasure, plus 永字八法 presets. **終筆 terminals are per-stroke**,
  auto-set from KanjiVG (止め/はね/左払い/右払い/点 — a property of each stroke's
  geometry, not its order); **click any stroke on the paper to override its ending**.
  Bleed uses an **ink-depletion model** (wet at 起筆, drying toward 収筆), not a flat halo.
- **F2** Multi-character input (kanji + kana + sentences), grid + 縦書き, via a
  float-texture **median atlas** (one draw call per glyph cell).
- **F3** Grade-level kanji lists (kyōiku 1–6) in the browser rail.
- **F4** Stroke-order numbers, toggleable, on a crisp 2D overlay.
- **F5** English → kanji search (offline), click a chip to append.
- **F6** Glyph size control; DPR-aware render.
- **F7** PNG export (washi or transparent), offscreen at export scale.

See `HANDOVER-fude.md` for the full brief and acceptance criteria, and
`.deban/` for the decision log (dead ends + lessons).

## Rebuilding the data

The bundled `assets/data/*.json` is prebaked. To regenerate (e.g. to widen the
glyph set), fetch the source corpora into `tools/.cache/` and run the preprocessor:

```bash
mkdir -p tools/.cache
curl -o tools/.cache/graphicsJa.txt      https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parsimonhi/animCJK/master/graphicsJa.txt
curl -o tools/.cache/graphicsJaKana.txt  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parsimonhi/animCJK/master/graphicsJaKana.txt
curl -o tools/.cache/kanji.json          https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davidluzgouveia/kanji-data/master/kanji.json
curl -L -o tools/.cache/kanjivg.xml.gz   https://github.com/KanjiVG/kanjivg/releases/download/r20160426/kanjivg-20160426.xml.gz
gunzip -f tools/.cache/kanjivg.xml.gz     # → tools/.cache/kanjivg.xml (per-stroke terminal types)
node tools/build-data.mjs                 # GRADES=1,2 node tools/build-data.mjs  to narrow
```

## Versioning / cache-busting

A layered cache-busting toolkit (`scripts/bust.sh`) stamps one token into the
asset URLs, the `<meta name="cb">` tag, and the favicon. The same token drives the
**version badge top-left** (three shape tiles + the 8-char build token next to the
title) so a human can confirm at a glance which build is live. Bump it with:

```bash
./scripts/bust.sh                                 # one-shot
bash ~/.claude-kainode/skills/cache-busting/scripts/watch.sh   # auto-bump on save (dev)
```

Runtime `fetch()` calls are fingerprinted via `js/util/version.js` (`withV`), keeping
the data layer on the same cache key as the code.
